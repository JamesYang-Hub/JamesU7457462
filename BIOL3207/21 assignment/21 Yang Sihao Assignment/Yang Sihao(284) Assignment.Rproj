#the Null and alternative hypotheses
H0<-milk caps are Poisson distributed around the forest
H1<-milk caps are NOT Poisson distributed around the forest

#I'm going to use Poisson Distribution and χ2 Statistic. Poisson distribution is used to calculate the probability of an event occurring over a certain interval. The interval can be one of time, area, volume or distance. and χ2 Statistic could evaluate the distance between the two distributions.


```{r}
milkcap.df <- read.csv("milkcap.csv.", stringsAsFactors = T)
milkcap.df
```

```{r}
milkcaps.mean<-weighted.mean(milkcap.df$specimens,milkcap.df$count)
```

λ=μ

```{r}
milkcap.range<-0:4
p<-dpois(milkcap.range,lambda = milkcaps.mean)
expected<-p*sum(milkcap.df$count)
expected
```

```{r}
plot(milkcap.df$specimens, milkcap.df$count, 
     type = "h", 
     lwd = 3, 
     col = "steelblue",
     xlab="specimens", 
     ylab="count")
lines(milkcap.df$specimens, expected,     lwd = 3, 
     col = "tomato4",)
```


```{r}
milkcap.df$count_expected<-round(expected,2)
milkcap.df
```

```{r}
chisq<-chisq.test(milkcap.df$count,  p=milkcap.df$count_expected, rescale.p = T)
chisq
```


#Given the p-value<0.05, we can accept H0. the data provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the milk caps are fitted Poisson distrbution.
